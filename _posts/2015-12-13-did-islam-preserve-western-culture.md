# Did Islam preserve Western Culture?

This is the common view, but, in fact, the facts seem to show something diametrically opposed: the spread of Islam [came very close to destroying Western Civilization.][0] Paradoxically, what saved it were the (much vilified) Crusades, which created the model of "Christian Europe", which, while still deeply divided, was Christian enough to resist the onslaught. See [this video.][1] Or [this one.][2]
