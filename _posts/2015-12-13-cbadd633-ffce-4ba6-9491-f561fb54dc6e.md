It has been said that a distinguishing feature of the "Next" world war is that most people don't know it is in progess. The Next world war is one between Islam - a psychopathic ideology, which has managed to conquer much of the world over the last 1400 years, and Western civilization, which has been dominant in the world since, roughly, the middle of the eighteenth century, and previously for roughly five hundred years between the time of Alexander the Great and the decline of the Roman Empire - Western civilization was almost destroyed by Islam during the period of some six hundred years starting with the seventh century.
